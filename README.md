Description: The application includes typical features such as booking appointments for customers at a designated salon. Specifically, customers can select and schedule appointments at the nearest salon to their address, ensuring suitable timing and appropriate service personnel. It incorporates a mechanism to filter duplicate appointments and provides alerts when users select conflicting ones. The Notification screen assists receptionists in changing the appointment status and viewing the history of status changes (cancellations, acceptances, etc.).
From the customer's perspective:
